# Simple Udemy Clone (HTML & CSS)

This repository contains the code for a basic Udemy clone website built using HTML and CSS. This project serves as a foundational example of front-end web development, demonstrating fundamental skills in creating a user interface and styling a website.  It's a great starting point for learning HTML and CSS.

**Features:**

* **Course Listing:** Displays a list of sample courses with titles and brief descriptions.  (Images are optional)
* **(Optional) Course Detail Pages:**  If implemented, allows users to click on a course for more information.
* **(Optional) Basic Styling:**  Includes CSS for basic styling and layout.  May include responsive design elements.

**Technologies Used:**

* HTML5
* CSS3

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Open `index.html`:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

**Project Structure:**

* `index.html`: The main HTML file.
* `styles.css` (or similar): The CSS file containing styles for the website.
* `images/` (optional): A folder containing any images used in the project.


**Further Development:**

This project is a starting point and can be significantly expanded upon.  Consider adding:

* **JavaScript:** Add interactivity with JavaScript for features like filtering, sorting, and dynamic content loading.
* **Backend Integration:** Connect to a database to manage courses and user data (requires learning a backend language and framework).
* **Advanced Styling:** Improve the visual appeal and user experience with more advanced CSS techniques and potentially a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
* **Responsive Design:** Ensure optimal viewing across all devices (if not already implemented).
